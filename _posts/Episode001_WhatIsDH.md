[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - [@zmstell](https://github.com/zmstell): Alright, hello everyone in cyberspace, I’m Zach Stella and today I am here with my co-host Rebecca Parker.  
  
[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - [@RJP43](https://github.com/RJP43): Hi there! Welcome to the very first episode of the plain.txt podcast - an entirely student-led initiative aimed to discover, de-stigmatize, and debate Digital Humanities topics. This podcast is produced by the Digital Humanities Master’s Students at [Loyola University Chicago]() and we are proudly supported by the [CTSDH - Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities](), [Loyola’s University Libraries]() and [Digital Media Services](). 
  
Becca: Today we will be addressing our field's question of the century: What is Digital Humanities? We sat down with Loyola's CTSDH Directors, [Dr. Elizabeth Hopwood]() and [Dr. Kyle Roberts]() to ask them for their go-to DH definitions - which you are about to hear in just a few. Some weeks later Zach and I gathered fellow Digital Humanities students [Taylor Brown]() and [Tyler Monaghan]() along with our Loyola Chicago affiliated friends [June Coyne](), a History PhD, and Computer Science Alum [Griffin Moe]() to reflect on Hopwood's and Robert's responses. We'll jump right into our #debatingDH session after hearing from Hopwood and Roberts - so let's take a listen to what they had to say when asked "What is Digital Humanities?"

Becca: How have our perceptions of DH changed and what is the future of Digital Humanities? *(I don't think we need to say who is about to speak again... there is a clear pattern here)*
