# Coming to `term{ ][s][ination]`    
````
means looking at your plot of land and reeping what you s{ow][we <feminize>]

zeniths and valleys, vitals on a monitor
beeping

repeating 

beeping 

repeating 《I want visual of heart monitor, github repos from org view with commit monitor visualization, and drawing of people together as the digital art and Inspo from this section》

like a restitched line
re{visting][membering] where you|we were when learning AND lost 《boolean》
— feelings we must come to terms with. 

and as one chapter comes to term
each new page returns to its close{ ][d past 

giving context of the chapters to come 
but lasting presently 《juxtopozing words of vary time connotations: giving, to come, lasting, presently》a book in hand (dis)regarded by medium-makers for it's presence -- "real"-ity.
This shifting weight like layered pages in these hands affects me,

like I mean physically or maybe the word is viscerally but also emotionally! I cant detach this feeling of existence weighing heavily down wondering can't you see][:eyes:]?

modes to monitor are at every single finger tip: typing, taping, timing, tracking

《call back to beeping and repeating imagery》

the existence of this entire world 
recorded with every click. 

IF learning and be][do{ing are two in the same then we need to reflect and connect. find the patterns to OUT 《link this to UD out regarding LGBTQ + and out stmts》 algorithms.
ELSE 《if else stmt .. haha》 what are we really learn][do][be{ing?

certainly not human 
... being ...
too mechanic][tradition{al —
now doesnt that sound oxymoronic-al《? if it's not a word it is now》
Let's seek [our] potential
socie][communi{TY... 
me. Are there patterns to read?

Let's see...

Well...coming to [graduate][grad school] has meant coming to terms with me OR we 《is this another boolean joke.. indeed》 that is my tiny community with in LUC 《tiny in comparison to ya know... the 🌐》... so here's my MA summary:

coming to term: 

《stats》
《some ideas, 
I still follow more than I'm followed.
Stir more than I sit but definitely lay more than I stand. Yet, this has stayed the same.




Like my weight <well relatively.🙄>
I've battled a bug of the flu variety at least twice but I'm vaccined<lol vaccinated> so I'd probably skew that to 5 to count internally. hmmm a difference of 3.

Now wondering ... do I notice a moment to link these numbers in seeking something with meaning to me ... like 253 
the address housing ailing ancestorial bodies of my blossoming tree. or 396 
a number I've mistakenly said instead of 365 too many times when first learning my address in my Aunt's office at PTC .. that's a Pittsburgh company long gone unlike those haunting memories from when 396 on a festively named street changed me. 

I digress to past chapters but only to remind you that places like people in our lives provide handlebars to hold onto and if we're to mark our paternal <at on pattern full hmmm> ][eternal shifts it's worth noting where we've been 《link timemap to places I've vistited -- curated and Google map for intense data peek》

Nevertheless numbers aren't nuanced enough because 4 and 1 are equally noticed by me for more reasons than I can put simply. And that's the spectrum. 

but I guess that how I've been all along
all or nothing ... so either way too much of something.

hello everyone out there in cyberspace. we're together at last for the very first first episode of the plain.txt podcast. Welcome. 

I'm coming to you from my 《little》 studio apt space. Currently sitting among my dresses, books, and toy dinosaurs in the third most populated US city— Chicago, IL. [yay/cheering sound effect/maybe?]

And at a time in my life where I am just having to come to terms with things. Do you know the feeling?
