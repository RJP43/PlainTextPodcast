# coming to `term{ ][s][ination]`  
means looking at your plot of land and reeping what you s{ow][we `<feminize>`]  
a restitched line is re{visting][membering] where you were when learning—  
a feeling we must come to terms with.   
  
and as one chapter comes to term  
lifting each new page to return it with][to its close{ ][d past gives not only context of chapters to come but the shifting weight of layered past pages within my space and these hands e`<?>`][affects me 

like I mean physically or maybe the word is viscerally AND emotionally! I cant detach this feeling of existence weighing heavily down, don't you see][:eyes:]?

learning and be][do{ing are two in the same and if we cant reflect and connect then what are we really learn][do][be{ing. 

certainly not human 
... being ...
too mechanic][tradition{al —
seek [our] potential
socie][communi{TY. 

with me.


hello everyone out there in cyberspace. we're together at last for the very first first episode of the plain.txt podcast. Welcome to this gathering of my `connecti][transmiss{ions` `originat][stemm{ing` from my `work[s]` in Digital Humanities and Textual Studies. Submerged in a community, expanded through engagement, this very first episode comes at the emergence of me finishing my master's degree. With thoughts (my own and others) to share to and among the communities of which I hope to be `teach][be{ing` now and into the future. This podcast hopes to bring people together in `learn][do][be{ing` digital humanitarians.
