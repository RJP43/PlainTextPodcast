# Coming to `term{ ][s][ination]`    
means looking at your plot of land and reeping what you `s{ow][ew`.   
A restitched line is `re{visting][membering` where you were when learning —  
Lost — a feeling we must come to terms with.   
  
`This][Every` chapter comes to term    
lifting each new page to return it to its `close{ ][d` past giveing context of chapters to come     
but this shifting weight of layered past pages within my space and in these hands affects me...   

like I mean physically or maybe the word is viscerally AND emotionally!    
I cant detach this feeling of existence weighing heavily down,   
don't you see|:eyes:?  
  
Learning and `be][do{ing` are two in the same and if we cant reflect and connect then what are we really `learn][do][be{ing`.   
  
Certainly NOT human   
... being ...  
too `mechanic][tradition{al` —
seek `[our]` potential
`socie][communi{TY][me`. 

hello everyone out there in cyberspace. we're together at last for the very first episode of the plain.txt podcast. Welcome to this gathering of my `connecti][transmiss{ions` `originat][stemm{ing` from my `work[s]` in Digital Humanities and Textual Studies. Submerged in a community, expanded with each new engagement, this very first episode comes at the emergence of me finishing my master's degree among the scholars at LUC. With thoughts (my own and others) to share to and among the communities of which I hope to be `teach][be{ing` now and into the future. This podcast hopes to bring people together in `learn][do][be{ing` digital humanitarians.
