[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - [@zmstell](https://github.com/zmstell): Hello everyone in cyberspace, I’m Zach Stella and today I am here with my co-host Rebecca Parker.  How's it going?
  
[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - [@RJP43](https://github.com/RJP43): Doing great, thanks Zach! And welcome every body to the very first episode of the plain.txt podcast - this is an entirely student-led initiative aimed to discover, de-stigmatize, and debate Digital Humanities topics. This podcast is produced by [Loyola University Chicago](https://www.luc.edu/) Digital Humanities Master’s Students and friends. We are proudly supported by [Loyola's Center for Textual Studies and Digital Humanities](https://www.luc.edu/ctsdh/).
  
[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48): Today we will be addressing the field's question of the century: What is Digital Humanities? We sat down with Loyola's CTSDH Directors, [Dr. Elizabeth Hopwood](https://twitter.com/LizzieHopwood) and [Dr. Kyle Roberts](https://twitter.com/kylebroberts) to ask them for their go-to DH definitions. 

[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396): Zach and I then gathered fellow Digital Humanities students [Taylor Brown](https://twitter.com/AdventScholar)-[@taylorcate](https://github.com/taylorcate) and alum [Tyler Monaghan](https://twitter.com/TyMonaghan)-[@tymonaghan](https://github.com/tymonaghan) along with our Loyola Chicago affiliated friends [June Coyne](https://twitter.com/junipercoyne)-[@jcoyne](https://github.com/jcoyne47), a History PhD, and Software Engineering Alum [Griffin Moe](https://twitter.com/griffin_moe)-[@gmoe](https://github.com/gmoe) to reflect on Hopwood's and Robert's responses. We'll jump right into our [#debatingDH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DebatingDH?src=hashtag_click) session after hearing from Hopwood and Roberts - so let's take a listen to what they had to say when asked "What is Digital Humanities?"     
  
[Hopwood](https://twitter.com/LizzieHopwood) - So, the definition that I tend to go to is that digital humanities is the intersection of computational and social science methods and methodologies applied to the study of the humanities, but that it can also go the other way around. That it's applying that set of humanistic questions and a humanistic methodology to the study of the digital. One of my favorite resources for students, or anybody who has their computer in front of them, is [whatisdigitalhumanities.com](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/)  This was made by [Jason Heppler](http://jasonheppler.org/). Quotes about 'What is DH?' were pulled from DH practitioners during the [Day of DH](http://twitter.com/DayofDH) between 2009 and 2014, and every time you hit refresh a new definition comes up. So you can get a wide range of how people are defining the field.

[Roberts](https://twitter.com/kylebroberts) - I think I tend, because there are so many definitions out there, to really like [Kathleen Fitzpatrick's](https://twitter.com/kfitz) definition that DH is the application of digital sources and approaches and methodologies to age-old humanistic questions, but also the flip part of that: that digital humanities is about using the humanities to really help us better understand the digital age that we've found ourselves in. I will say that depending on the audience that often elicits a variety of different responses, and I guess I'd add that one of the things that I get a lot from the public is the sense that DH is an oxymoron, right? The digital and the humanities? How could they possibly work together? I think Fitzpatrick's definition helps us sort of understand, but it often has to be followed by a concrete example. I do a lot with library catalogues. IF you look at a manuscript library catalogue there is a ton of information in there but it's just really hard to access in its material, analog format. Being able to digitize it and scan it and then upload it to a database and analyze it really opens up the world of possibilities. And I find that when you do that, when you sort of walk people through the process, they start to better understand what it is we are trying to do in DH.

[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - I wrote down that one of the main characteristics of DH is the reflection of the term itself and what it could mean to different people, and that one of the big pillars of studying of DH is trying to challenge the notions about what it is. Like it's this sort of evasive term that we're not trying to put into a box. We're trying to move it around, and that allows us the flexibilty to study many different things. What are your guys's thoughts on that?

[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - I mean, definitely. And that's why so many people reference this [whatisdigitalhumanities.com](https://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/), because it does aggregate all these different opinions about it. I will say though that I have often been kind of annoyed by some of those definitions that get up there, because they either cut too shy of what I'd like DH to be held up to as a standard of study in a sense, or also are so vague...

[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - What do you think is missing from their definitions, or like why does that create that sort of feeling in you that it's incomplete?

[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - That's a good question.

[Taylor](https://twitter.com/AdventScholar) - I feel like DH is sort of a field of doing, whereas a lot of other fields, especially in the humanities, aren't necessarily. A lot of other humanities fields are sort of in the position of sitting back and seeing how things play, seeing how the research can be advanced, seeing people in the conversation makes it go a little further, but in DH it's more like self-motivated doing. Through the sheer will of the people in it, bringing those connections to the surface. Bringing those things together.

[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - Yeah. I definitely agree. I think later on in my notes I write that I guess it's this very empowering, I guess, feminized field and it encourages like the-- it allows us to get into discussions that are already happening within history contexts or english or literary contexts talking about these same things. Challenging grand narratives or like grand notions about what it is, or however you apply that question to trying to find somebody's voice and <??> Having disagreements and having those arguments between your terms. I never think that it should be locked down to 'this is DH, this is.' It expands pretty quickly in terms of what we can talk about when we say 'doing?' I guess that's a good thing to go off of. Not only are we questioning what we're doing, but it's good to also articulate what we are doing. When you saying 'doing,' what do mean by 'doing?' 

[Taylor](https://twitter.com/AdventScholar) - I feel like because of computational studies and the power there is with that, and the power of visibilty and understanding access, and the power of the internet, we are empowering humanities scholars to really make their research have an impact. It's not so much just a siloed very pointed sharing between inner circles of exclusivity. It's like... here's how to put this on the web. Here's how as many people as possible will see it, and is your research worth a lot of people seeing? And I think and I've found that a lot of digital humanities projects, it is worth seeing and it is being seen. So it is that moving target. It is hard to define, it is hard to pin down. But it's a lot of people doing some amazing things, and talking about it with each other.

[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48) - That's true. What are your guys's other thoughts, in terms of doing? What do we do in DH, do you think?

[Becca](https://twitter.com/bcpkr396) - Yeah, I mean, I think it becomes the reason probably I often am against some of these 'What is DH?' definitions, of 'DH is just digitizing!' or 'DH is just creating a website for somebody else's humanities research.' I feel that like the doing part of it is being on both ends of that conversation. It's taking action in the creation of digital things, but also reflecting on that creation and having some stake in what it is that is being digitized. Because without having that stake in it, there's not really a desire to do the action. I think it's like a full thing to be what really DH is. And that's why, like, Tyler's [State of the Union database project](https://twitter.com/SOTU_db) is that.

[Tyler](https://twitter.com/TyMonaghan) - Yeah, it's always been to me much easier to define by example than by a strict definition. I do definitely agree that there's this reflexive urge to need to define it in terms of how you can explain it to others in a way that will make sense to other people, and I think that's natural. But I also think that's-- the big thing is, is digital humanities going to exist as such, by that name, in 10 or 15 or 30 years or whatever? Or is it just going to be, you know. I often just describe my project to people as it's a history project that I did with a lot of computer stuff. Because I'm usually speaking to a non-technical audience and everything. So is digital humanities going to continue to be its own...? Right now it's this thing that has a center and we're fighting for funding and getting visibility and recognition within the university and within academia is a big deal and an important part of the path to legitimacy. And so like does going down that path successfully mean becoming a big department that's just as flourishing as the other biggest departments at the university, or does it mean not really existing anymore and just being absorbed into the practices of the College of Arts and Sciences?

[June](https://twitter.com/junipercoyne) - I was just thinking in terms of what you're saying, and like-- because you framed the reason to have a definition is to explain it to other people. Because I was just thinking of why do we need a definition? Because in some sense I think that is a valid but kind of narrow reason to have a defintion. There's also like we define something so you can constrict it, you can constrain what is part of it. And I think that is also in this case not actually useful, right? I think what we get at with definitions that is useful is an aspirational definition, that the definition should include the values we are striving towards in our projects. And I think that 'doing' is a value that we strive for in digital humanities. And I think the humanities side of it in asking humanistic questions, really kind of digging into how it relates to people is also a really important part of it? And then like the embrace of technology, the embrace of the digital is a part of it. So when I think of definitions it's not so much in a sense of I have to define this to make sure I fit within it, but in terms of like I want to have a definition that inspires me to try to achieve the things it contains.   
  
[Zach](https://twitter.com/zstella48): So what makes DH here at Loyola unique? Let's take a listen to what Dr. Roberts thinks. Then we'll hear back from Dr. Hopwood. And finally we'll follow-up like before with our [#debatingDH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DebatingDH?src=hashtag_click) reflections.
