# coming to `term{ ][s][ination]`  
means looking at your plot of land and reeping what you s{ow][we `<feminize>`]  
a restitched line is re{visting][membering] where you were when learning—  
a feeling we must come to terms with.   
  
and as one chapter comes to term  
lifting each new page to return it with][to its close{ ][d past gives not only context of chapters to come but the shifting weight of layered past pages within my space and these hands e`<?>`][affects me 

like I mean physically or maybe the word is viscerally AND emotionally! I cant detach this feeling of existence weighing heavily down, don't you see][:eyes:]?

learning and be][do{ing are two in the same and if we cant reflect and connect then what are we really learn][do][be{ing. 

certainly not human 
... being ...
too mechanic][tradition{al —
seek [our] potential
socie][communi{TY. 

with me.


hello everyone out there in cyberspace. we're together at last for the very first first episode of the plain.txt podcast. Welcome. 

I'm coming to you from my 《little》 studio apt space. Sitting currently among my dresses, books, and toy dinosaurs in the third most populated US city— Chicago, IL. [yay/cheering sound effect/maybe?]

And at a time in my life where I am just having to come to terms with things. Do you know the feeling? 

Alright.. before we delve into the te][motions i recited moments ago some might be wondering what you've just stumbled upon. 
Well, the plain.txt podcast is first and foremost a digital humanitarian effort to share experiment][experienti{al knowledge. A gathering of my][our connecti][transmiss{ions originat][stemm{ing from my][our work[s] in Digital Humanities and Textual Studies. Submerged in a community, as expansive as my own][our engagement, this very first episode comes at the emergence of me finishing my Master's degree. With thoughts (my own and others) to share to and among the communities of which I hope to be teach][be{ing now and into the future. This podcast hopes to bring people together in learn][do][be{ing humans of a digital persuasion or rather digital humanitarians. 

So this piece - 《coming to term 》 has so much meaning for me personally, but I imagine the idiom[definition ✔] strikes each of us in our own way. I'm wondering who can relate? Please reach out and let me know if you can. Let me know your first thoughts when hearing the phrase 《coming to term 》 via our hashtag on ANY and ALL social media #PlainTxtPodcast 

I wrote this spoken word poem trying to do a summation before the beginning of my next chapter in life after graduate school. So initially coming to term meant coming to an end and that's where I started writing the piece. How can I finish this? What needs to be said before I go? and then it got a little deeper. . .

In this very first line I saw the opportunity to branch and in a David Lynch-esque moment became very aware of my habit for not being able to come to terms in the sense of having the correct word{s][ing flow from me and I was flushed with a feeling of dread when I typed out termination ... returning to this idea that with every new beginning there is ending][severing][distancing.
