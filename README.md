> **Image Caption:** _Our website's banner, seen in the above image, primarily features our logo (a roughly, sketched spiral-notepad with "d.h." scribbled on the front). This logo was created by [Tyler Monaghan - @tymonaghan:octocat:](https://github.com/tymonaghan) in early 2018. After Tyler contributed the logo to our team's shared Google Drive, [Taylor Brown - @taylorcate:octocat:](https://github.com/taylorcate) created the image above by adding the "plain.txt podcast" text to the right of the notepad. You might notice the "plain.txt podcast" text of the above image differs slightly from our website banner's actual text. When developing the website [Griffin Moe - @gmoe:octocat:](https://github.com/gmoe) and [Rebecca Parker - @RJP43:octocat:](https://github.com/RJP43) spent a considerable amount of time reviewing a variety of possible fonts. In the end, primarily influenced by Griffin's design experience and the desire for minimalist aesthetic, the team decided on using font [`Noto Serif SC`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Serif+SC) for the headings on the podcast's website._
